What is Data Visualization? Data visualization is a field in data analysis that deals with visual representation of data. It graphically plots data and is an effective way to communicate inferences from data. Using data visualization, we can get a visual summary of our data. With pictures, maps and graphs, the human mind has an easier time processing and understanding any given data. Data visualization plays a significant role in the representation of both small and large data sets, but it is especially useful when we have large data sets, in which it is impossible to see all of our data, let alone process and understand it manually.

Data Visualization in Python: Python offers several plotting libraries, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn and many other such data visualization packages with different features for creating informative, customized, and appealing plots to present data in the most simple and effective way. Python provides various libraries that come with different features for visualizing data. All these libraries come with different features and can support various types of graphs.

Matplotlib Matplotlib is an easy-to-use, low-level data visualization library that is built on NumPy arrays. It consists of various plots like scatter plot, line plot, histogram, etc. Matplotlib provides a lot of flexibility

Plotly: Plotly is a Python library which is used to design graphs, especially interactive graphs. It can plot various graphs and charts like histogram, barplot, boxplot, spreadplot and many more. It is mainly used in data analysis as well as financial analysis. Plotly is an interactive visualization library. Here’s why – • Plotly has hover tool capabilities that allow us to detect any outliers or anomalies in numerous data points. • It allows more customization. • It makes the graph visually more attractive.
Using Plotly and Cufflinks together provides the power of interactivity and simplicity. Cufflinks makes it incredibly easy to visualize data stored in Pandas DataFrames, while Plotly ensures that the resulting plots are professional and highly engaging.

let’s see some commonly used plots using this library.

a. Scatter Plot: Scatter plots are used to observe relationship between variables and uses dots to represent the relationship between them. The scatter() method in the matplotlib library is used to draw a scatter plot. Scatter plots are widely used to represent relation among variables and how change in one affects the other.

b. line plot: It is a type of data chart that shows a progression of a variable from left to right along the x-axis through data points connected by straight line segments. Most typically, the change of a variable is plotted over time. Indeed, line plots are often used for visualizing time series

c.Bar plot: It is the most common data visualization for displaying the numerical values of categorical data to compare various categories between them. The categories are represented by rectangular bars of the same width and with heights (for vertical bar charts) or lengths (for horizontal bar charts) proportional to the numerical values that they correspond to.

d.Histogram: It is a type of data plot that represents the frequency distribution of the values of a numerical variable. Under the hood, it splits the data into value range groups called bins, counts the number of points related to each bin, and displays each bin as a vertical bar, with the height proportional to the count value for that bin. A histogram can be considered as a specific type of bar charts, only that its adjacent bars are attached without gaps, given the continuous nature of bins.

e.Box plot: It is a data plot type that shows a set of five descriptive statistics of the data: the minimum and maximum values (excluding the outliers), the median, and the first and third quartiles. Optionally, it can also show the mean value. A box plot is the right choice if you're interested only in these statistics, without digging into the real underlying data distribution.

f.Surface Plot: It is a three-dimensional (3D) plot used to represent data points with three variables: X, Y, and Z. It is essentially a 3D extension of a mesh or contour plot, where a surface is formed by connecting data points. Surface plots are ideal for visualizing relationships between three continuous variables and are often used in mathematical and scientific computations.

g.Bubble Plot: It is an enhanced version of a scatter plot that visualizes three dimensions of data in two-dimensional space. In addition to the X and Y coordinates, a bubble plot uses the size of the markers (bubbles) to represent a third variable, making it a powerful tool for visualizing relationships among multiple dimensions.
